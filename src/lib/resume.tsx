      Work: Focus solely on the task at hand until the timer rings. Avoid distractions and interruptions during this time.
      
      Short Break: When the timer rings, take a short break (usually around 5 minutes) to relax and recharge.
      
      Repeat: After completing a Pomodoro and taking a short break, start another Pomodoro. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break (usually around 15-30 minutes).`,
